# thetaStudioReload

thetaStudioReload based on Evothings Hyper-Reload is a lightweight tool for rapid development of mobile apps in JavaScript.

## What it does
Edit your HTML/CSS/JS on your desktop machine, save the edited file, and the changes are automatically reloaded on connected clients. This saves you from rebuild, deploy and restart your mobile application every time a code change is made. The result is a much faster workflow when coding HTML/CSS/JS.

Any number of clients can connect. You can connect from any browser (desktop or mobile), or you can connect from a mobile WebView widget of a native app (this should work on all mobile platforms that supports a Web widget, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Firefox OS, Tizen, etc).

## Getting started
This is currently being ported to Ricoh Theta-360 Degree Camera. Modification is still on-going
